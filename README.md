# Pizza Api 

<br/>

## Name : Pizza API
## Author : Okemawo Aniyikaiye Obaodfin (OAO)
#### Description : This is a small Java application that aims to mimic the API used by pizza houses to take orders from customers 

#### Build Instructions : After copying the C file to your terminal, use the "make" command to compile the c programs and generate a 'plaidsh' executable file. Run the executable to initialze the shell. Alternatively, an already generated plaidsh executable can be found in this repository and ran directly without the need for calling "make". 

<br/>

#### ðŸª¢ The functions that are used to make the shell operational are enumerated below.

#### 1. Read Word: Returns the first word from input, removing leading whitespace, handling double quotes, and translating escaped character. When called, word points to a buffer of word_len length. The read_word function places the translated word from input into the word buffer and returns the number of characters that were processed from input.
V2 Update : Adds support for recognizing redirection characters
